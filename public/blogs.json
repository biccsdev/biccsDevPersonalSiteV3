    "content": "We are living in the future.\n I remember all these Disney movies I watched as a kid, such as Wall-e, Tomorrowland, Tron, or Meet the Robinsons, just to name a few. I was amazed and excited at the same time by how robots, technology, and neon aesthetics played their roles. Perhaps these movies were envisioned to motivate young children to shape their minds and accelerate technology as they grow up. Maybe it was all a psychological operation to prepare us for building the future. In fact, the future is unfolding as I write these lines. \n At times, it's somewhat dystopian how accurately certain themes in these movies may become a reality. With Meta's Quest 3 launch, Apple's Vision Pro announcement, and the videos of people using Mixed Reality on social media, it reminds me of scenes from Wall-e. People on the spaceship were overweight and overstimulated, always seated in their chairs, consuming everything on holographic screens resembling mixed/augmented reality technology. We are at an inflection point where we must be conscious of these things and raise awareness about the user experience to prevent or at least not promote these behaviors. \n If we take a moment to contemplate this thoroughly, this situation also parallels our relationship with our phones. It's astonishing how addicted society, especially young kids and older individuals, is to their phones, directing all their attention to social media, or the latest TikTok trends. In my opinion, this won't turn out well, and it might even evolve into a new form of mental illness. People pour their attention into trivial matters most of the time, losing their ability to focus on basic tasks, not to mention their inability to complete moderately complex tasks like math or analytical thinking. I could continue discussing this, but I believe you understand the point. \n On the other hand, recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Digital Realities (Mixed/Augmented/Virtual Realities), along with smaller but significant movements like 3D printing and IoT, have the potential to transform the way our society operates. I never tire of informing everyone I know in real life about these advancements. Applications like ChatGPT and DALL·E-3, to name a few, will undoubtedly expedite the way people work. I want to emphasize how these technologies will accelerate research. Imagine how rapidly we will advance the development of new things with modern Artificial Intelligence compared to the early days of modern computing. \n The first personal computer, the Altair 8800, was launched in 1975—48 years ago. Consider how many advancements have occurred since then. The invention of the modern Internet, smartphones, and more—all achieved through human brainpower. This leads me to ponder what advancements will occur in the next 50 years with the use of modern Artificial Intelligence. Not to mention that we are approaching Artificial General Intelligence in the next 5-10 years, to be conservative. It's mind-boggling. \n The invention of the internet and the smartphone has dramatically changed our society's workings. New industries and concepts have emerged, and new ways of doing old things have materialized. For instance, from my perspective, TV is nearly obsolete. News and communication have undergone profound changes, and consumer behavior has also shifted significantly, thanks to advancements in the last 50-ish years. \n Now, with modern Artificial Intelligence, a few things come to mind:\n1. Many jobs that entail repetitive and tedious tasks will cease to exist in the traditional sense, as they'll be done by machines. \n2. Graphic designers and developers will drastically alter how they work. \n3. There will be a growing economic gap between tech-savvy individuals and the rest.\n4. Highly tailored entertainment will become more prevalent. \n5. Bioengineering technology may accelerate, possibly leading to digital immortality through consciousness uploads to the cloud.\n6. We may figuratively 'resurrect' important minds, such as Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, Aristotle, Picasso, and others, through complex neural networks trained with their life's work, represented by digital avatars and artificial voices for a better user experience. \nOther science-fiction concepts that have become reality include self-driving and electric cars, reusable rockets, space leisure vacations, and the U.S. government's confirmation of the existence of aliens. Though, to be honest, this last point doesn't seem entirely true, in my opinion. You can call me a conspiracy theorist, but I think it was a political move, haha. \n One of two things were predicted to become reality: matter teleportation and bringing places to us. With virtual reality's recent advancements, codec avatars, and gaussian splatting, it seems more feasible to bring places to us. Among many potential use cases for this tech stack, it should eventually allow us to visit any place in the world by donning a head-mounted display aka a virtual reality headset. Now, we need to figure out how to enhance the experience beyond visual input, allowing users to feel the environment, not just see it. \n What an exciting time to be alive! We are living in the right era to accelerate and achieve all these technological advancements. Join me on my journey to raise awareness about the current technological state of the world. Have a great journey, and keep building! \n Thank you for taking the time to read this article!"

    "content": "Introduction \n When the internet was created, it was nothing more than a network that connected universities throughout the United States, a simple means of communication that facilitated the sharing of scientific research; Nowadays the internet is a tool that we all use for many of our daily activities, however it was not always like that. The first version of the Internet was born with the public adoption of this network created by universities to share information, where users around the world could connect to this network and only consume information, with the development of new technologies what was a network to consume information ( web 1) became a network to consume and share information (web 2), where the companies we all know like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Netflix among many others, managed to make the internet a place where anyone in the world can create valuable content and share it with the whole world without the need to know programming or have technical computer knowledge, new concepts such as online banking, social networks, content creators, digital marketing, video game competitions were born; which allowed the birth of new industries.Every technological advance solves problems, but also creates many others; web 2 brought us many advances but with it it also brought us problems; of security and property, mishandling of data and little privacy. Web 3 aims to solve these problems, technologies have been developed and new concepts have been created with the aim of solving these problems, such as; decentralized finance, digital wallets, nft's, decentralized organizations, to name a few. \n In its beginnings, web 3 was a vision of creating a decentralized computer, one capable of processing and storing information in a secure, decentralized and censorship-proof manner, with this thought the Ethereum blockchain was born. A blockchain is nothing more than a set of computers connected to each other, whose purpose is to process and save transactions, with the condition that no computer connected to the network owns the information it manipulates. These computers connected to the network, or also called nodes, are rewarded with cryptocurrencies for supporting verifying transactions to the blockchain (network) that are connected (also called mining). To complement the understanding of web 3 and the blockchain, it is necessary to understand the concept of transaction. A transaction represents any interaction that a user makes with the blockchain, for example transferring cryptocurrencies to another person, buying an item, or any interaction where the user requests or sends information to a system connected to the blockchain. Transactions contain the information of who made the transaction, the addresses of those involved in the transaction, the time it was made, the assets that were transferred ( the assets can be only information ), among other things. \n Generally and depending on the blockchain, transactions will have a cost, this cost is called gas fee or transaction fee. While in some block chains such as Ethereum the gas fee is very expensive, costing up to 20 dollars per transaction (for example, it can cost 20 dollars to send 1 dollar to another person, this is due to network congestion), in In other block chains, such as Solana, transactions cost less than 0.50 US cents or can even be free depending on the type of transaction that the user is creating. This variation in the price of transactions is due to the way in which the blockchain validates them, which is called consensus protocols, which we will leave as a topic for another article. Now that you understand the basics of this ecosystem, we can dig deeper into the use cases and implementations that exist today. Use cases, The ability of this technology to create innovations in different industries is inevitable, we have the ability to transform the internet experience for users, some of the strongest use cases of this ecosystem are the following: 1. Privacy and Digital Identity 2. Decentralized Organizations 3. Decentralized Finance 4. Economy for Creators 5. Games on the blockchain. Privacy and Digital Identity, One of the big problems of the web 2 that we seek to solve is Digital Identity, there are countless times that we hear of hacking of accounts on social networks or of people posing as someone else, all this with negative effects on society. \n Transparency is also an important issue that is intended to be solved in this ecosystem. New investigations in cryptography present us with models such as zero-knowledge proofs, which allow the validity of transactions through mathematical equations without revealing information to anyone. For example, a user can prove to a website that they know a password without giving the password to the website, as a result, the user's password will never be saved on the website's server, thus the password will be more secure. We can be sure that one of the most important approaches of this new ecosystem aims to solve the serious information leak problems that arose in web 2.0.decentralized organizations. One of the most popular use cases on the web 3 is decentralized organizations, these are basically online communities under the ownership of their own members. A DAO does not have a central authority, the most interesting characteristic of these organizations is the ability of decentralized governance, that is, the members of the community can vote in the decisions of the direction of the organization, each organization is governed by different rules for what both voting systems can work differently. Decentralized organizations or DAOs are governed based on smart contracts (programs that exist in the blockchain) where the rules and structure of the organization are stipulated. These smart contracts may or may not be modified by some central entity (depending on the blockchain). \n Some DAOs that currently exist and should be highlighted are: MonkeDAO, the first decentralized organization on the Solana blockchain, its governance is governed by a collection of ntfs (Solana Monkey Business). Among its operations is the creation of a weekly information bulletin called Banana Split, a liquidity pool for staking, a validator node in the solana network, among other things. Cripto Cowboy DAO, a decentralized organization in the Solana network that is building an artificial intelligence model that aims to predict the price fluctuation in ntfs collections, members of this community can participate by making predictions and the system will feed the model with them. Currently there is a boom in the creation of DAOs, with the focus of creating DAOs within collections of NTFs, in my experience this makes a lot of sense since within the web3 ecosystem most of the users are in the communities of ntfs, in these communities you find thousands and thousands of people sharing common ideas and interests. Commonly, NFT collections have different attributes which can be included in a piece of the collection or not, community members choose a specific attribute from the collection and create a DAO where only members with an NFT that includes that attribute can belong and make decisions about the direction of the organization. Decentralized Finance, In the past and present we have only used centralized finance, where we keep our money in a bank, they offer us the service of keeping our money safe but in return we pay them in one way or another, either through fixed installments or free accounts, the bank uses our money as collateral in its different day-to-day operations, obtaining an extra benefit on our saved money. These processes that the bank uses to obtain an extra profit on our money stored in bank accounts were out of our reach, until now, thanks to decentralized finance. Now we can use cryptocurrencies to offer loans to third parties, give liquidity to a currency exchange center or receive an annual return, or any existing financial transaction but in a decentralized way, without bank intervention. \n Another great use case for decentralized finance is one of the most basic uses of money, making transactions. In traditional finance, to make an international transfer, withdraw or deposit money or buy some good, we need to verify with the bank if the transaction is possible, they have the power to decide whether or not we can send or spend our money in any way, this It is resolved with decentralized finance since in this ecosystem there is no central entity that has power over our money. Basically, in decentralized finance there are no banks, instead there are pieces of code that function based on the principles of banking but without a central entity. Stablecoins are another fruit of decentralized finance, these are currencies that are linked 1:1 with some asset, the most common use case is the dollar, these are currencies that are linked 1:1 with the dollar, which means that each of these currencies can only be worth what the dollar is worth, that is why they are called stablecoins, because their price is stable in relation to the asset, in this case the dollar. Decentralized finance stands out as one of the most important aspects among real-world web3 use cases, as it presents prolific opportunities to enhance financial inclusion.\n The connection of decentralized finance and web3 depends on the fact that decentralized finance services embrace fundamental values in the open Internet. These are the notable indicators that show how decentralized finance and web3 relate to each other. Dedication to open source code, Lower transaction fees, open accessibility Transparency and accountability in governance without permission, Privacy and security based on encryption. Economy for Creators, This term was coined with the creation of web2, when users were given the ability to create content for the internet without needing to know about website creation and all the infrastructure that goes with it. However, these processes are currently controlled by the companies that own the platforms, where they decide when, how and how much content creators are paid. This problem is intended to be solved in the web3 ecosystem, creators can create and manage their communities without the need for third parties, this is possible thanks to the decentralization of content platforms, where creators have ownership of their content since this It is stored in a decentralized way on the blockchain.\n For the most part, content creators focus on attracting audiences within NFT communities, usually content creators launch collections of NFTs for sale, which allows them to capitalize on the sale of NFTs and depending on the blockchain and from the marketplace the creator earns royalties for every sale on the secondary market. These collectibles allow users to acquire them, special benefits from that content creator, be it videos, articles, valuable information, among other things.This monetization model for content creators is very new, often the web3 community is looking to improve and scale ways to monetize content without the need for a central entity.Games on the blockchain, These days the vast majority of games have in-app purchases, whether it's for collectibles, unlocking cosmetic items, or new parts of the game. However, all of these transactions are closed to each of the different ecosystems in each game, which means that an item purchased in one game cannot be used in another game or items cannot be transferred from one account to another. The premise of this use case is that games developed on the blockchain allow for custom and independent economies, where players have full ownership of the items in their inventory, allowing them to sell and trade items with other players, creating a decentralized economy within games. Platforms, within the web 3 there are applications that help us carry out the activities available in the ecosystem. These applications are used by the community to communicate, carry out transactions, play games, analyze the blockchain, collect data, among other things. \n Magic Eden, is a platform that serves as a secondary market for all NFT collections, in this system you can discover new collections, buy and sell NFTs, see a global ranking of Solana and Ethereum NFTs. Twitter, is one of the most important social networks in this ecosystem today, here you can connect with people, discover new communities, listen to live chats with project founders, keep up to date with ecosystem news and meet new people. Discord, just like Twitter is one of the most important social networks in the ecosystem, in discord you will find the servers of each of the communities of the web3 projects, on these servers you will have chats with the members of the community, chats with the team behind the projects, general announcements, important information, dynamics, among many other things.Hello Moon, is a tool used to analyze the price behavior of the different collections on the Solana blockchain. Here you can see analytics such as the collections with the most flow in different periods of time, you can see who is buying what NFT, you can analyze the price charts of the collections, you can manage your portfolio, among other things. Famous Foxes, this platform is created by a project of NFTs called Famous Fox Federation, the platform consists of a series of useful tools for the ecosystem such as: token market, Tool to create raffles, Tool to create NFTs, Tool to trade goods P2P, just to mention a few, NFT holders in this collection benefit from extra tools and systems. Sol Incinerator, \n This system is created by another collection of NFTs called Sol Slugs, this system has a simple goal, it helps us burn unwanted tokens and NFTs, and as a reward we get some cryptocurrency back.This tool is one of the most useful since it solves a big problem in the ecosystem, it helps us get rid of fake tokens that only seek to empty our wallet. Conclusion, the overview of web3 based on the main use cases shows how it can change Internet experiences completely. From DAOs to the metaverse to decentralized finance, web3 has a lot in store for everyone. While some of the web3 use cases have already started to make an impact, some of them are still in development. Massive adoption is to be expected, but for this we need to go a long way, create systems with friendlier and more efficient user interfaces, as well as implement the use cases in existing web2 operations."

    "content": "We are about to enter an impressive era, building the future, the way we interact with society, if you are interested in this topic an interesting adaptation to our near future awaits you. Imagine a tool that allows us to meet people from all over the world, visit worlds created by the creativity of the community, buy and sell goods, create content, communities, basically it is the internet we have today, but the premise of the metaverse is that all these interactions happen in a 3D world, either a totally virtual world or a mixed reality world where virtual aspects are combined with the real environment. While our current metaverse happens through a 2D world, and we access it through our computers, cell phones, consoles, smart speakers, the future metaverse will be accessed through all these devices, but its main focus will be through virtual reality or augmented reality devices. \n What is the Metaverse? \n The word Metaverse inherits from Universe all its characteristics and combines them with the concept of Meta, which refers to something that refers to itself as metadata that is data that has information about other data. In this case, the metaverse refers to a virtual platform where we create universes with communities, jobs, learning, economy, communication and entertainment, all connected to each other, creating the great metaverse. Of course, the word metaverse is just a label for this concept, in the future another word may be used to refer to the same thing. \n Current State Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp, Youtube, Twitch, to mention a few, are places on the internet where millions of people meet and interact every day, here we find communities of all niches, people communicating with their friends by video call, sending messages to their friends, also buying things through online stores, using credit lines from technology companies like stori or rappi, consuming multimedia content and streaming video games. All these activities are the daily life of millions of people and are even the way many of them make a living, but there is a big problem. \n Scalability which is roughly speaking the ability to make something grow, today an average content creator creates content for youtube, takes clips to upload it to facebook and tiktok, takes his merch for sale with shopify and publishes all his ads to the community on discord or twitter, however he lacks ownership over his content, all those videos, likes, followers and comments, do not belong to the content creator.\n All the information we give to the platforms where we interact is stored in the computers (servers) of these companies, therefore they own all that information, they are even the owners and creators of most of the processes of the businesses that use these technologies, so if one day these companies change the way their tool works, your business would have to change the way it works, involving unnecessary costs and time or they could even totally block the access to the information that is supposed to be yours if they wanted to. Currently, Google and Microsoft are the owners of our identity on the internet, since the moment we create an account on any platform, we create it using our gmail or hotmail, this represents a serious problem because we are subject to the authority of these companies that have the power to censor us, since they own all our data. On the side of virtual reality, facebook now meta, leads the market with the launch of virtual reality glasses quest 2, thanks to this hundreds of thousands of new people have been interested in this technology, which points to a good adoption in the coming years, however the biggest challenge we have with this technology is the control we have as users over the worlds with which we interact, there is VR Chat, Rec Room, Meta Horizons, these are the most popular metaverses that exist at this time for virtual reality users, where they can visit worlds, meet new people and express themselves using any kind of avatar you can imagine, however as users we have no control over what happens in these platforms, since the companies that own these metaverses dictate the rules and changes that happen in these worlds, another important issue I would like to mention is that these current metaverses do not have a system of economy or property, as people in these worlds we can not own anything, much less buy or sell goods. Remember we are talking about metaverses in virtual reality. There are also 2D metaverses, such as decentraland, the sandbox, world wide webb, which have the characteristics that virtual reality metaverses do not have. These 2D metaverses live on blockchain technologies, which allows users to own the places or things they interact with, for example you can buy apartments (in opensea which is basically an amazon of NFTS) that you can use in the world wide webb metaverse that range from 2. 14 ETH which is approximately $6,300 DLLS, where you can decorate it with your own NFT's, invite your friends and chat inside this apartment, you can also sell it to another person or give it away if you want, because you are the owner of this piece of software that represents an apartment in a virtual world, neither google nor microsoft or epic games are owners of this digital asset, but only you. Your NFTS, cryptocurrencies, the history of transactions you have made, all this is stored in a wallet (digital wallet), more on this later. Technologies/Tools Needed To solve these problems, different technologies have been developing that come to evolve the way we interact with the internet, with the help of web3, blockchain technology and virtual reality. State of these technologies It is important to take into account the current state of these technologies needed to build the metaverse.\n First, what is web 3? It is the evolution of the internet that we use today, which allows us to have services such as social networks, cloud computing, real-time services, among many others. It needs to be open and decentralized, platforms built on web 3, exist on open protocols that do not require third parties or intermediaries. For example, unlike a centralized social network like facebook that exists on company computers, a decentralized web 3 social network exists on the computers of a decentralized network on the blockchain like ethereum. The participants of these platforms own their own content and receive ownership of their profiles on the platforms. For example, in a decentralized social network your information belongs to you as a user not to the owner of the platform. This technology will allow us to create decentralized worlds or platforms where economies will exist by exchanging digital assets. These digital assets will be represented by money, contracts, properties, etc... Currently this technology already exists, however the use of it is very low due to the problems of scalability, user friendly interfaces, and standardization that it faces. First, what is a blockchain, think of it this way, the current internet is composed of various servers (computers) that we access every day like facebook, instagram, twitter.\n A blockchain represents the same but built in a different way, instead of accessing the computers of the companies, we access a network of 'private' computers connected to each other, where the information of all these applications is stored, no one owns these applications because no one owns all the computers on the network, but this shared database exists thanks to the joint work of a community of people who come together to create the network. Decentralized networks or block chains such as Solana, Cardano and Ethereum, store applications that exist in parts in all computers in the network at the same time, these applications are known as Smart Contracts, these contracts allow interacting with them through transactions. We need standardization in the technologies needed to build web 3 projects, as we need to develop these standards for massive adaptation by developers, thus facilitating the development path and obtaining a greater flow of decentralized application development. \n Virtual and augmented reality are also necessary technologies for the future vision of the internet, currently the company Meta, formerly facebook is the one that dominates the virtual reality industry with its Meta Quest 2 device, and Apple dominates on the side of augmented reality, which although they do not have a device dedicated to this has been responsible for equipping their cell phones with augmented reality technology and has developed much technology needed to develop AR and XR applications. The biggest problems presented by these technologies fall in the hardware area with the need for more immersive devices that allow us to express body language and on the other hand, like web 2, decentralization. Concept I propose the following concept, create a virtual world that is accessed through a browser or a native application, where there are properties and streets that connect them.\n The ownership of a property is described in a NFT through a smart contract, this property allows you to host a server where multiple systems can exist, both the systems and the server must allow interaction through virtual reality or augmented reality. A property can be a store with its point of sale systems, inventory, etc.. It can also be an office with an assistant system, computers, or it can also be a video game room. The streets represent the connections between these properties, thus creating cities, where users can walk down the street and enter establishments, buy things, open businesses, have personalized homes, all this on a layer of technologies that allow users to create on this universe. \n Thanks for taking the time to read this text!."
