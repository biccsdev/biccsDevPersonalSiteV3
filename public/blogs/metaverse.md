## The Metaverse: Building the Future

We are on the cusp of an exciting era, where we're shaping the future of how we interact with society. If you're intrigued by this topic, an exciting adaptation to our near future awaits. Imagine a tool that enables us to connect with people from all corners of the world, explore worlds born out of community creativity, engage in commerce, create content, establish communities, and essentially, it's the internet we have today but with a twist: the Metaverse. In the Metaverse, all these interactions occur in a 3D world, whether it's a fully virtual realm or a mixed-reality environment where virtual elements blend with the real world. While our current Metaverse exists in 2D and is accessed through computers, phones, consoles, and smart speakers, the future Metaverse's primary focus will be virtual reality and augmented reality devices.

## What is the Metaverse?

The term "Metaverse" combines "Universe" with "Meta," which denotes something referring to itself or serving as metadata (data about other data). In this context, the Metaverse represents a virtual platform where we create interconnected universes encompassing communities, jobs, education, economy, communication, and entertainment. It's essentially the grand Metaverse. Of course, "Metaverse" is just a label for this concept, and in the future, a different term may be used to describe the same idea.

## Current State

Presently, platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Twitch are online spaces where millions of people meet and interact daily. These platforms host diverse communities, support video calls among friends, facilitate online shopping, leverage credit services from tech companies, and offer multimedia content and game streaming. These activities are integral to millions, even serving as their livelihood. However, a significant problem arises: scalability.

Scalability, in this context, refers to the ability to facilitate growth. Content creators often create content for platforms like YouTube, post clips to Facebook and TikTok, sell merchandise through Shopify, and engage with their communities on Discord or Twitter. However, they lack ownership over their content. Videos, likes, followers, and comments don't belong to the creators; they're owned by the platforms.

All the data shared on these platforms is stored on the companies' servers. Consequently, the companies own this information, including the processes that underpin these businesses. If these companies decide to alter how their tools operate, it can necessitate costly and time-consuming changes or even block access to information that's supposed to be yours. Google and Microsoft currently own our online identities since we create accounts using Gmail or Hotmail. This dependence on these companies raises concerns about censorship and data control.

In the realm of virtual reality, Facebook (now Meta) leads with the Quest 2 virtual reality glasses. While this technology shows potential for adoption, it's hindered by limited user control within the virtual worlds. Metaverse platforms like VR Chat, Rec Room, and Meta Horizons are popular, but users have no say in the rules or changes made by the companies that own these metaverses. Another key limitation is the absence of an economy or ownership system. Users in these virtual reality metaverses cannot own, buy, or sell virtual goods.

In contrast, there are 2D metaverses like Decentraland, The Sandbox, and the World Wide Webb, which offer features that virtual reality metaverses lack. These 2D metaverses are built on blockchain technology, allowing users to own the places or objects they interact with. For example, users can purchase apartments (in marketplaces like OpenSea) that they can furnish with their own NFTs and interact with others. The ownership is decentralized and not controlled by tech giants like Google or Microsoft.

## Technologies and Tools Needed

To address these problems and shape the future Metaverse, several technologies are in development. Web3, blockchain technology, and virtual and augmented reality are key components. However, the current state of these technologies requires consideration.

### Web3

Web3 represents the evolution of the internet, moving beyond the current web (Web2) to offer open and decentralized services. Platforms built on Web3 rely on open protocols that don't require intermediaries. In a decentralized social network, for instance, your information belongs to you as a user, not the platform's owner. However, the adoption of Web3 is limited due to issues like scalability, user-friendly interfaces, and standardization.

### Blockchain

Blockchain is a distributed network that stores applications in a shared database. No single entity owns these applications since they exist across the network's computers. Blockchain includes smart contracts, which allow for interactions via transactions. Standardization is vital for the mass adoption of blockchain technology.

### Virtual and Augmented Reality

Virtual reality and augmented reality technologies are essential for realizing the vision of the Metaverse. Facebook (Meta) and Apple dominate these spaces, with devices like the Meta Quest 2 and AR capabilities integrated into iPhones. Challenges in this area include the need for more immersive devices and the requirement for decentralization.

## The Concept

Here's a proposed concept: create a virtual world accessible through a web browser or a native application. In this world, properties and streets connect, and ownership of properties is defined by NFTs through smart contracts. These properties host servers that enable various systems, with interaction supported via virtual reality or augmented reality. Properties can range from stores with point-of-sale systems to offices with assistant systems or even video game rooms. Streets represent connections between these properties, forming cities where users can navigate, make purchases, start businesses, and establish personalized homes. This universe operates on technologies that empower users to create and control it.
