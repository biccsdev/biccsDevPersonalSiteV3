This christmas I wanted to something fun and special to raise awareness about technology in my family, also from some time now I've been wanting to bootstrap an AR application of some sort, as this along side with Virtual Reality are two of my favorite fields in the software industry. I've been following a couple of X accounts like [this](https://twitter.com/XRarchitect) and [this](https://twitter.com/Natzke) for some time now that sporadically share their AR creations, and I've been asking about which technologies are they using to create these experiences, so far I've been made aware about the following:

- [AR.js library](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/) AR library for the web
- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) which can be used for AR and VR on the web
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) realted to all 3D stuff on the web

as you can see on this short list I boostraped, I'm mainly focused on Web Development as I think it's the best way to approach AR at the moment just because most of the people on earth have an smarthphone with which they can easily access these AR experiences by just scanning a QR code to navigate to the AR application and scan the same QR code that has a Barcode embbebed within which serves as a tracking point for the AR augmentation model.

_You can scan this qr code to navigate to the AR application, and keep scanning it to show the AR augmentation_
