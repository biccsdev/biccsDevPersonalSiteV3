We are living in the future. I remember all these Disney movies I watched as a kid, such as Wall-e, Tomorrowland, Tron, or Meet the Robinsons, just to name a few. I was amazed and excited at the same time by how robots, technology, and neon aesthetics played their roles. Perhaps these movies were envisioned to motivate young children to shape their minds and accelerate technology as they grow up. Maybe it was all a psychological operation to prepare us for building the future. In fact, the future is unfolding as I write these lines.

At times, it's somewhat dystopian how accurately certain themes in these movies may become a reality. With Meta's Quest 3 launch, Apple's Vision Pro announcement, and the videos of people using Mixed Reality on social media, it reminds me of scenes from Wall-e. People on the spaceship were overweight and overstimulated, always seated in their chairs, consuming everything on holographic screens resembling mixed/augmented reality technology. We are at an inflection point where we must be conscious of these things and raise awareness about the user experience to prevent or at least not promote these behaviors.

If we take a moment to contemplate this thoroughly, this situation also parallels our relationship with our phones. It's astonishing how addicted society, especially young kids and older individuals, is to their phones, directing all their attention to social media, or the latest TikTok trends. In my opinion, this won't turn out well, and it might even evolve into a new form of mental illness. People pour their attention into trivial matters most of the time, losing their ability to focus on basic tasks, not to mention their inability to complete moderately complex tasks like math or analytical thinking. I could continue discussing this, but I believe you understand the point.

On the other hand, recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Digital Realities (Mixed/Augmented/Virtual Realities), along with smaller but significant movements like 3D printing and IoT, have the potential to transform the way our society operates. I never tire of informing everyone I know in real life about these advancements. Applications like ChatGPT and DALL·E-3, to name a few, will undoubtedly expedite the way people work. I want to emphasize how these technologies will accelerate research. Imagine how rapidly we will advance the development of new things with modern Artificial Intelligence compared to the early days of modern computing.

The first personal computer, the Altair 8800, was launched in 1975—48 years ago. Consider how many advancements have occurred since then. The invention of the modern Internet, smartphones, and more—all achieved through human brainpower. This leads me to ponder what advancements will occur in the next 50 years with the use of modern Artificial Intelligence. Not to mention that we are approaching Artificial General Intelligence in the next 5-10 years, to be conservative. It's mind-boggling.

The invention of the internet and the smartphone has dramatically changed our society's workings. New industries and concepts have emerged, and new ways of doing old things have materialized. For instance, from my perspective, TV is nearly obsolete. News and communication have undergone profound changes, and consumer behavior has also shifted significantly, thanks to advancements in the last 50-ish years.

Now, with modern Artificial Intelligence, a few things come to mind:

- Many jobs that entail repetitive and tedious tasks will cease to exist in the traditional sense, as they'll be done by machines.
- Graphic designers and developers will drastically alter how they work.
- There will be a growing economic gap between tech-savvy individuals and the rest.
- Highly tailored entertainment will become more prevalent.
- Bioengineering technology may accelerate, possibly leading to digital immortality through consciousness uploads to the cloud.
- We may figuratively "resurrect" important minds, such as Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, Aristotle, Picasso, and others, through complex neural networks trained with their life's work, represented by digital avatars and artificial voices for a better user experience.

Other science-fiction concepts that have become reality include self-driving and electric cars, reusable rockets, space leisure vacations, and the U.S. government's confirmation of the existence of aliens. Though, to be honest, this last point doesn't seem entirely true, in my opinion. You can call me a conspiracy theorist, but I think it was a political move, haha.

One of two things were predicted to become reality: matter teleportation and bringing places to us. With virtual reality's recent advancements, codec avatars, and gaussian splatting, it seems more feasible to bring places to us. Among many potential use cases for this tech stack, it should eventually allow us to visit any place in the world by donning a head-mounted display aka a virtual reality headset. Now, we need to figure out how to enhance the experience beyond visual input, allowing users to feel the environment, not just see it.

What an exciting time to be alive! We are living in the right era to accelerate and achieve all these technological advancements. Join me on my journey to raise awareness about the current technological state of the world. Have a great journey, and keep building!
