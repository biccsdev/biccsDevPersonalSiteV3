## Introduction

When the internet was created, it was nothing more than a network that connected universities throughout the United States, a simple means of communication that facilitated the sharing of scientific research; Nowadays the internet is a tool that we all use for many of our daily activities, however it was not always like that. The first version of the Internet was born with the public adoption of this network created by universities to share information, where users around the world could connect to this network and only consume information, with the development of new technologies what was a network to consume information (web 1) became a network to consume and share information (web 2), where the companies we all know like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Netflix among many others, managed to make the internet a place where anyone in the world can create valuable content and share it with the whole world without the need to know programming or have technical computer knowledge, new concepts such as online banking, social networks, content creators, digital marketing, video game competitions were born; which allowed the birth of new industries.

Every technological advance solves problems, but also creates many others; web 2 brought us many advances but with it it also brought us problems; of security and property, mishandling of data and little privacy. Web 3 aims to solve these problems, technologies have been developed and new concepts have been created with the aim of solving these problems, such as; decentralized finance, digital wallets, nft's, decentralized organizations, to name a few.

In its beginnings, web 3 was a vision of creating a decentralized computer, one capable of processing and storing information in a secure, decentralized and censorship-proof manner, with this thought the Ethereum blockchain was born. A blockchain is nothing more than a set of computers connected to each other, whose purpose is to process and save transactions, with the condition that no computer connected to the network owns the information it manipulates. These computers connected to the network, or also called nodes, are rewarded with cryptocurrencies for supporting verifying transactions to the blockchain (network) that are connected (also called mining).

To complement the understanding of web 3 and the blockchain, it is necessary to understand the concept of transaction. A transaction represents any interaction that a user makes with the blockchain, for example transferring cryptocurrencies to another person, buying an item, or any interaction where the user requests or sends information to a system connected to the blockchain. Transactions contain the information of who made the transaction, the addresses of those involved in the transaction, the time it was made, the assets that were transferred (the assets can be only information), among other things.

Generally and depending on the blockchain, transactions will have a cost, this cost is called gas fee or transaction fee. While in some block chains such as Ethereum the gas fee is very expensive, costing up to 20 dollars per transaction (for example, it can cost 20 dollars to send 1 dollar to another person, this is due to network congestion), in other block chains, such as Solana, transactions cost less than 0.50 US cents or can even be free depending on the type of transaction that the user is creating. This variation in the price of transactions is due to the way in which the blockchain validates them, which is called consensus protocols, which we will leave as a topic for another article.

Now that you understand the basics of this ecosystem, we can dig deeper into the use cases and implementations that exist today.

## Use cases

The ability of this technology to create innovations in different industries is inevitable, we have the ability to transform the internet experience for users, some of the strongest use cases of this ecosystem are the following:

1. **Privacy and Digital Identity**

2. **Decentralized Organizations**

3. **Decentralized Finance**

4. **Economy for Creators**

5. **Games on the blockchain.**

**Privacy and Digital Identity:**
One of the big problems of the web 2 that we seek to solve is Digital Identity, there are countless times that we hear of hacking of accounts on social networks or of people posing as someone else, all this with negative effects on society.

Transparency is also an important issue that is intended to be solved in this ecosystem. New investigations in cryptography present us with models such as zero-knowledge proofs, which allow the validity of transactions through mathematical equations without revealing information to anyone. For example, a user can prove to a website that they know a password without giving the password to the website, as a result, the user's password will never be saved on the website's server, thus the password will be more secure. We can be sure that one of the most important approaches of this new ecosystem aims to solve the serious information leak problems that arose in web 2.0.

**Decentralized organizations:**
One of the most popular use cases on the web 3 is decentralized organizations, these are basically online communities under the ownership of their own members. A DAO does not have a central authority, the most interesting characteristic of these organizations is the ability of decentralized governance, that is, the members of the community can vote in the decisions of the direction of the organization, each organization is governed by different rules for what both voting systems can work differently. Decentralized organizations or DAOs are governed based on smart contracts (programs that exist in the blockchain) where the rules and structure of the organization are stipulated. These smart contracts may or may not be modified by some central entity (depending on the blockchain).

Some DAOs that currently exist and should be highlighted are:

- MonkeDAO, the first decentralized organization on the Solana blockchain, its governance is governed by a collection of ntfs (Solana Monkey Business). Among its operations is the creation of a weekly information bulletin called Banana Split, a liquidity pool for staking, a validator node in the solana network, among other things.
- Cripto Cowboy DAO, a decentralized organization in the Solana network that is building an artificial intelligence model that aims to predict the price fluctuation in ntfs collections, members of this community can participate by making predictions and the system will feed the model with them.

Currently there is a boom in the creation of DAOs, with the focus of creating DAOs within collections of NTFs, in my experience this makes a lot of sense since within the web3 ecosystem most of the users are in the communities of ntfs, in these communities you find thousands and thousands of people sharing common ideas and interests. Commonly, NFT collections have different attributes which can be included in a piece of the collection or not, community members choose a specific attribute from the collection and create a DAO where only members with an NFT that includes that attribute can belong and make decisions about the direction of the organization.

**Decentralized Finance:**
In the past and present we have only used centralized finance, where we keep our money in a bank, they offer us the service of keeping our money safe but in return we pay them in one way or another, either through fixed installments or free accounts, the bank uses our money as collateral in its different day-to-day operations, obtaining an extra benefit on our saved money. These processes that the bank uses to obtain an extra profit on our money stored in bank accounts were out of our reach, until now, thanks to decentralized finance. Now we can use cryptocurrencies to offer loans to third parties, give liquidity to a currency exchange center or receive an annual return, or any existing financial transaction but in a decentralized way, without bank intervention.

Another great use case for decentralized finance is one of the most basic uses of money, making transactions. In traditional finance, to make an international transfer, withdraw or deposit money or buy some good, we need to verify with the bank if the transaction is possible, they have the power to decide whether or not we can send or spend our money in any way, this It is resolved with decentralized finance since in this ecosystem there is no central entity that has power over our money. Basically, in decentralized finance there are no banks, instead there are pieces of code that function based on the principles of banking but without a central entity.

Stablecoins are another fruit of decentralized finance, these are currencies that are linked 1:1 with some asset, the most common use case is the dollar, these are currencies that are linked 1:1 with the dollar, which means that each of these currencies can only be worth what the dollar is worth, that is why they are called stablecoins, because their price is stable in relation to the asset, in this case the dollar. Decentralized finance stands out as one of the most important aspects among real-world web3 use cases, as it presents prolific opportunities to enhance financial inclusion.

The connection of decentralized finance and web3 depends on the fact that decentralized finance services embrace fundamental values in the open Internet. These are the notable indicators that show how decentralized finance and web3 relate to each other.

- Dedication to open source code
- Lower transaction fees, open accessibility
- Transparency and accountability in governance without permission
- Privacy and security based on encryption.

**Economy for Creators:**
This term was coined with the creation of web2, when users were given the ability to create content for the internet without needing to know about website creation and all the infrastructure that goes with it. However, these processes are currently controlled by the companies that own the platforms, where they decide when, how and how much content creators are paid. This problem is intended to be solved in the web3 ecosystem, creators can create and manage their communities without the need for third parties, this is possible thanks to the decentralization of content platforms, where creators have ownership of their content since this It is stored in a decentralized way on the blockchain.

For the most part, content creators focus on attracting audiences within NFT communities, usually content creators launch collections of NFTs for sale, which allows them to capitalize on the sale of NFTs and depending on the blockchain and from the marketplace the creator earns royalties for every sale on the secondary market. These collectibles allow users to acquire them, special benefits from that content creator, be it videos, articles, valuable information, among other things.

This monetization model for content creators is very new, often the web3 community is looking to improve and scale ways to monetize content without the need for a central entity.

**Games on the blockchain:**
These days the vast majority of games have in-app purchases, whether it's for collectibles, unlocking cosmetic items, or new parts of the game. However, all of these transactions are closed to each of the different ecosystems in each game, which means that an item purchased in one game cannot be used in another game or items cannot be transferred from one account to another. The premise of this use case is that games developed on the blockchain allow for custom and independent economies, where players have full ownership of the items in their inventory, allowing them to sell and trade items with other players, creating a decentralized economy within games.

## Platforms

Within the web 3 there are applications that help us carry out the activities available in the ecosystem. These applications are used by the community to communicate, carry out transactions, play games, analyze the blockchain, collect data, among other things.

- **Magic Eden**, is a platform that serves as a secondary market for all NFT collections, in this system you can discover new collections, buy and sell NFTs, see a global ranking of Solana and Ethereum NFTs.

- **Twitter**, is one of the most important social networks in this ecosystem today, here you can connect with people, discover new communities, listen to live chats with project founders, keep up to date with ecosystem news and meet new people.

- **Discord**, just like Twitter is one of the most important social networks in the ecosystem, in discord you will find the servers of each of the communities of the web3 projects, on these servers you will have chats with the members of the community, chats with the team behind the projects, general announcements, important information, dynamics, among many other things.

- **Hello Moon**, is a tool used to analyze the price behavior of the different collections on the Solana blockchain. Here you can see analytics such as the collections with the most flow in different periods of time, you can see who is buying what NFT, you can analyze the price charts of the collections, you can manage your portfolio, among other things.

- **Famous Foxes**, this platform is created by a project of NFTs called Famous Fox Federation, the platform consists of a series of useful tools for the ecosystem such as: token market, Tool to create raffles, Tool to create NFTs, Tool to trade goods P2P, just to mention a few, NFT holders in this collection benefit from extra tools and systems.

- **Sol Incinerator**, This system is created by another collection of NFTs called Sol Slugs, this system has a simple goal, it helps us burn unwanted tokens and NFTs, and as a reward we get some cryptocurrency back. This tool is one of the most useful since it solves a big problem in the ecosystem, it helps us get rid of fake tokens that only seek to empty our wallet.

## Conclusion

The overview of web3 based on the main use cases shows how it can change Internet experiences completely. From DAOs to the metaverse to decentralized finance, web3 has a lot in store for everyone. While some of the web3 use cases have already started to make an impact, some of them are still in development. Massive adoption is to be expected, but for this we need to go a long way, create systems with friendlier and more efficient user interfaces, as well as implement the use cases in existing web2 operations.
